# IPAP Form

## Intro
The *Independent Progress Assessment Panel* (IPAP) is the 
[Annual Review](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/student-administration/research-students/progression/independent-progress-assessment-panel/)
for research students at the University of Liverpool.

And I need to fill in a form explaining the importance 
of my research.

## Markdown vs .docx
But *first things first*, I wrote a Python script to convert
the .docx files they sent us into markdown.

Because there is no need for the zipped set of twenty .xml 
files (picture 1 is the full set, picture 2 is the key
`document.xml` file) that make up a .docx file, when you
could have the same content more conveniently delivered
in a simple 239 word markdown text file (compare picture 3).

## Terminological Jargon
What is the difference between an *aim* and an *objective*?

According to [leanarts.org.uk](https://www.leanarts.org.uk/advice/aims-objectives-outcomes-outputs-whats-difference),

> **Aims** often start with *To...* and describe changes...

while

> **Objectives** are... the activity...

and 

> **Outcomes** are the chnages you will have caused...

which should have measurable **indicators**.
