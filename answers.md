# School of Environmental Sciences: Annual Progress Proforma for Year 1 PGR students

Please complete the following questions, limiting your answer 
per question to 200 words or less and return to Joe Sheridan 
at least one week before the date of your IPAP interview. 
This document will be circulated to your interview panel. 

Name: Peter Prescott
Project Title: The Geodemographics of British Streets
Supervisors: Alex Singleton


## What will your project achieve? 

This PhD will develop a method that creates a public geodemographic classification; 
that in addition to utilising the best of open data; couple these with other data sources 
and generate more timely and accurate measures of populations and their contexts. The
project will develop innovative techniques that utilise street geometry in their specification,
estimation and testing; as the site for social interaction and the construction of neighbourhoods.

## State why this PhD project is important.

*Historically*, humankind is in the early stages of an unprecedented *data revolution*
-- and geographic/spatial data in particular pose unique challenges.
*Economically*, a recent Cabinet briefing suggested use of geospatial data could
unleash Â£10 billion.
But *critically*, advances in data analytics can have evil consequences too (whether
deliberate or accidental), and so it is imperative that research be open, ethical
and reproducible.

## State how the knowledge gained from the project will be put to use by other researchers or the non-academic community (industry, charities etc).

Geodemographic classifications are of use in every sector which deals with real people 
in particular places. In business it is useful for marketing; in politics, campaigning;
in government, for evaluating policy; in churches and charities, for understanding how
to see and serve the needs of people in particular places.

The underlying methodology that I develop will be applicable to other areas of spatial
analysis than merely geodemographics itself, and will be used by statisticians, social
scientists, and population geographers in all the various fields of work which consider
human life in real world places.

The code that I write and the research that I do will be shared openly, and will be
used and improved by those addressing similar problems.

## Give three or four aims for the proposed research. Keep each of these research aims to one sentence.

- To develop a new methodology for zone design in small area statistics, based on the natural 
unit of *the street*, rather than ad hoc administrative areal divisions.
- To bring together a comprehensive array of available open data sources to generate new insight.
- To enable a better understanding of the nature and needs of local communities.

## Matching each of the research aims (listed in 4) outline the objectives to this research project: what they will do and what they will achieve.

1. Use Street Network Graph (as available through Ordnance Survey's Master Map or Open Street Map) to partition the UK on the basis of street layout. 
2. Create a new open geodemographic data resource for the whole United Kingdom, using machine learning to cluster street-level neighbourhoods into statistically similar groupings. 
3. Use web technology to facilitate individualized interaction with current data.

## State the three or four most important published manuscripts you have read this year and why you felt they were important to your PhD topic. 

- Webber, R., and Burrows, R. (2018). The Predictive Postcode: The Geodemographic Classification of British Society.
    * gives a historical overview of the development of geodemographics,
    * while engaging with various critiques of geodemographics,
    * and demonstrating its application to understanding contemporary social patterns.

- O'Sullivan, D., and Unwin, D. (2003). Geographic Information Analysis.
    * foundational account of first principles that is both accessible and rigorous.

- Law, S. (2017). Defining Street-Based Local Area and measuring its effect on house price...
    * a ground-breaking first attempt at defining a street-based local area.

- Boeing, G. (2018). Planarity and street network representation in urban form analysis.
    - addresses the challenges of representing street networks as 'approximately' planar graph networks.
 
## Outline the progress you have made, with reference to the aims and objectives above, over the past year. 

- Gave a talk on the founding fathers of *Geographic Information Science*: Longley,
Maguire, Goodchild & Rhind. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/gds-longleyetal/).
- Gave a presentation on the development and application of Agent-Based Modelling
in the social sciences. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/gds-abm/).
- Wrote software to create simulation of agents interacting in a spatial field.
[See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/agent-based-modelling/).
- Created app to visualize research-paper citations as a network graph. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/citations/).
- Wrote a paper examining the QLFS 2012 and considering the question of
secularization in Britain, and the relationship between religiosity, age, and sex.
- Wrote a paper analyzing the 2011 Census data to assess which features of small
areas were the best predictors of home ownership. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/regression-modelling/).
- Gave presentation reviewing and critiquing Kim Knotts' spatial analysis of religious-secular relations. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/qualitative-research-paper/).
- Wrote paper reviewing the qualitative method of urban walking, as practised within 
the framework of *psychogeography*, in critical dialogue with my own Evangelical
epistemology, ethics, and experience. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/qualitative-methods/).
- Combined multiple open datasets to create a geodemographic classification of the
political constituencies of Britain. [See link](https://geodemographics.co.uk/projects/envs615_analysis-of-human-dynamics_201442927/).
- Created implementations in Python of the Perceptron Algorithm](https://github.com/peterprescott/perceptron) and the K-Means Clustering algorithm. [See link](https://github.com/peterprescott/kmeans).
