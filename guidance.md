PGR Annual Progress: advice and instructions for students
At the end of each academic year (May-June), all PGR students go through an assessment of annual progress. The first stage of this assessment is conducted by an Independent Progress Assessment Panel (IPAP), normally consisting of two or three independent academic members of staff from SoES. In the IPAP interview, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of your PhD topic and showcase the academic progress that you have made over the past 9 to 12 months. Progress procedures are put in place to support your development as a PhD student and ensure you flourish here in Liverpool. It is also an opportunity for you to point out any obstacles you feel are preventing you from making good academic progress. Obstacles include health or wellbeing issues, problems with your supervisor, laboratory or field issues, inadequate support etc. All conversations and information disclosed in the IPAP are CONFIDENTIAL. The panel will not discuss information from the IPAP with other members of staff and all issues raised by you in the IPAP will be handled sensitively. Based on the PGR progress form (year 1) or PhD plan (years 2, 3 and 4) and the interview, the panel will make a recommendation on your progress and registration. The possible outcomes are:
For Students that are not yet due an annual review, their initial registration on the programme is confirmed and he/she is permitted to continue on their programme and re-register for the next academic session
That the student’s initial registration is downgraded to MPhil and he/she is permitted to re-register for the next academic session under the revised qualification aim
That the student has made satisfactory progress and is permitted to re-register for the next academic session
That the student has not made sufficient satisfactory academic progress but is permitted a further period of time under review and their academic progress will be assessed further by the Progress Assessment Panel
That the student has not made satisfactory academic progress and that his/her studies be terminated immediately
That the student should be deemed withdrawn and his/her studies be terminated under the deemed withdrawn procedures
